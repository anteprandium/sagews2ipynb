# sagew2ipynb

This little script converts a Sage Math Cloud online worksheet, (`.sagews`) into an iPython notebook (`.ipynb`), with engine Sage 6.6. This is  useful because iPython notebooks are the only format common to both Sage in local mode and Sage Math Cloud, so you can push/pull files as needed.

See folder examples for an example of a converted notebook.

The image inclusion is completely untested.
